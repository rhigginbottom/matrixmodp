Description: Provides functions for row-reducing and inverting matrices with
    entries in many of the finite fields (those with a prime number of 
    elements). With this package, users will be able to find the reduced row 
    echelon form (RREF) of a matrix and calculate the inverse of a (square, 
    invertible) matrix.
