## Resubmission

In response to the feedback about the initial submission, I have done the following:  

* edited the title of the package as suggested.

The mathematical methods behind the functions in this package are basic to a first course in Linear Algebra. The R methods don't have any good reference to list as far as I know, so I did not make any of the related suggested changes to the DESCRIPTION file.

The only information messages that are written to the console in this package are error messages which accompany a fatal error. These seem necessary so a user knows what to fix in order to avoid future fatal errors. Therefore, I did not make any changes corresponding to this suggestion.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

* This is a new release.
